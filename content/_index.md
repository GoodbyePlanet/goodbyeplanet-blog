Hi there, I'm [GoodbyePlanet](https://github.com/GoodbyePlanet).

This blog site it intended to be place where I or you (put here link to contribute)
will occasionally add small trivial blogs about things that we learned during our work as developers.
Blogs will be about anything that can improve readers life or about things that might be interesting to know
and that are from IT world.

Every blog should be small and should not take reader more than 2 minutes to read and understand.
