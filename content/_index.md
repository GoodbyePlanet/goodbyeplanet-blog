Hi there, I'm [GoodbyePlanet](https://github.com/GoodbyePlanet).

This blog site it intended to be a place where I or you ([Contribute](/contribute))
will occasionally add small trivial blogs about things that we learned during our work as developers.
Blogs will be about anything that can improve readers life or about things that might not improve readers life but might be interesting to know
and that are from IT world.

Every blog should be small and should not take more than 3 minutes to read and understand.
