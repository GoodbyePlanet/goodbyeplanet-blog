Hi there, I'm [GoodbyePlanet](https://github.com/GoodbyePlanet).

This blog site it intended to be a place where I will occasionally add small trivial blogs about things that I've learned
during my work as a Web developer.
Blogs will be about anything that can potentially improve your life or about things that might not improve your life at all but
might be interesting to know.

Every blog will be small and should not take more than 3 minutes to read and understand. Also, if you have topic
that you can summarize in 3 minutes, and you're willing to share it here, fill free to do so. Instructions to
contribute are [here](/contribute).
