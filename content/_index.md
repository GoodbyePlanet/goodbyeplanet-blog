Hi there, I'm [GoodbyePlanet](https://github.com/GoodbyePlanet).

This blog site it intended to be a place where I will occasionally write about things that I've learned
during my work as a Software Developer.

I will strive to write blogs that are easy to understand and that will not take more than 10 minutes to read and understand. Also, if you have a topic
that you can summarize in 10 minutes, and you're willing to share it here, fill free to do so. Instructions to
contribute are [here](/contribute).
